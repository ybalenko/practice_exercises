# Practice Exercises

This [repository](https://github.com/ybalenko/practice_exercises.git) contains code samples that are written in Python and follow test-driven development (TDD) approach. 
TDD is a development technique where you must first write a test that fails before you write new functional code. 
For the tests, I use Unit testing framework [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html).


The basic building blocks of unit testing are test cases. In unittest, test cases are represented by [unittest.TestCase](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase) instances.
